Objective:
Develop a real-time latency monitoring tool using publicly available network measurement platforms (e.g., RIPE Atlas or Pingdom) that collects latency data and visualizes it on an interactive dashboard. The tool should monitor latency trends across various regions and identify anomalies or outliers.
Tools and Skills Needed:
Python for data collection and analysis.
Matplotlib or Plotly for visualizing latency data.
Flask or Streamlit for creating a simple web dashboard.
APIs (e.g., RIPE Atlas API) for collecting data.
Pandas for data manipulation and analysis.
Project Steps:
Setup and Data Collection:


Explore RIPE Atlas or another network monitoring platform's API to collect real-time latency data.
Use Python to write a script that fetches latency data across various regions or countries (choose a few regions to start).
Store this data in a CSV or SQLite database for processing.
Data Processing and Analysis:


Use Pandas to process the collected data: compute average latency, maximum latency, standard deviation, and detect latency spikes (e.g., outliers).
Implement logic to identify anomalous latency events (e.g., latencies above a threshold).
Data Visualization:


Use Matplotlib or Plotly to visualize the latency data over time.
Create interactive charts that display latency trends for different regions or endpoints.
Show historical trends alongside real-time data to highlight changes in network performance.
Alerting System (Optional):


Implement a simple alerting system that notifies users when latency crosses certain thresholds.
Alerts can be email-based or via a web notification.
Web Dashboard:


Build a web-based dashboard using Flask or Streamlit to display the latency data in real time.
Include interactive features like time filters (show data for the past week/month), region filters, and an option to see detailed latency trends per region.
Final Testing and Documentation:


Test the entire tool to ensure data is being fetched correctly, processed accurately, and visualized without issues.
Document the project, explaining the data collection process, how the tool works, and how it can be expanded or integrated with other data sources in the future.
